— An Employee Registration Management System is a distributed application that will be developed to maintain the details of employees working in any organization. It would maintain the information about the personal details of employees, so that the human resource of the organization can easily know the details of all its employees. It would be simple to understand and can be used by anyone who is not even familiar with legacy employees’ system.
